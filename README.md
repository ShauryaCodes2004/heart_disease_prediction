# heart_disease_prediction ⤵️
we know that these days there are a lot of heart patients so this ML model which is based on Logistic_Regression helps to tell whether the person is suffering from a heart disease or not am open to further contributions to this project also the data set I have used is attached u can check it below
##  training model has an accuracy of 85% 
I have split the data into two parts one is the training data set with an accuracy of 85%
## testing model has an accuracy of 81 %
now when it comes to another data its the testing one having an accuracy of 81%
## reason for low accuracy is : -
* due to less data
* if i had trained the model having larger amount of data it could have hit an accuracy of 95 and above i will firther be making changes in this project
* THANKS FOR VIEWING MY PROJECT
